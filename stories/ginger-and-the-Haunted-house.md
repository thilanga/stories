# Ginger and the Haunted House

One day, Ginger the cat was out for a walk. Then she met her friend Pat the cat. Pat was a really brave and adventurous cat. He always likes to dare Ginger in daring challenges. He told Ginger that he saw a haunted house at the end of the street. He said he wanted to challenge Ginger by going to the house and see which cat could stay there the longest. Ginger was afraid but she determined to do it.

So both cats went into the house and then they split up. Ginger went to the left and Pat went to the right. Ginger heard a creaking sound from a cupboard. She went cautiously towards the cupboard. When she opened the cupboard door, loads of bats and ghosts flew out of the cupboard. Ginger was terrified and she ran up the stairs. Then she heard a noise from a door. She went into the room and there was a witch holding Pat. There was a ghost guarding her. Ginger didn’t know whether to runaway or to rescue Pat. She couldn’t leave Pat with the witch.

So ginger quietly and calmly stepped into the room. “Well, well, well. Looks like we’ve got a visitor!” said the witch. Then Ginger quickly ran up to the ghost, swiped it with her paw and the ghost disappeared. Then the witch scolded at Ginger with rage. Pat got up his paw and scratched the witch on her arm.  The witch dropped Pat and then sent an army of vampires chasing the two cats out of the door.

When they got out, vampires locked all the doors and windows. When Ginger looked at Pat, he was as white as a ghost. “What’s wrong?” asked Ginger. “Nnnn... Nothing” said Pat shackingly. Then Pat turned to Ginger and said, “I was only pretending to be brave and adventurous.” Then Ginger leaned in close to him and whispered “I was only pretending to be brave and adventurous too..”. Both cats laughed and from that day on, Pat never challenged Ginger again.

The end.
